title:  Simplified Semantic Data Modeling
lead: An approach for modeling data of multiple domains that enables Subject Matter Experts to contribute to controlled vocabularies with minimal data modeling expertise.
---

The _Simplified Semantic Data Modeling_ (`S2DM`) is an approach for modeling data of multiple domains.
It is **_simple_** in the sense that any _Subject Matter Expert_ (SME) could contribute to a controlled vocabulary with minimal data modeling expertise.
Likewise, it is **_semantic_** in the sense that it specifies meaningful data structures, their cross-domain relationships, and arbitrary classification schemes.

{{< callout context="note">}}
Bear in mind the word _**Simplified**_ in the name.
This approach aims to foster the adoption of (some) good data modeling practices.
It does not intend to re-invent or replace long-standing standards, such as those of the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Main_Page).
Therefore, it does not incorporate advanced reasoning capabilities or comprehensive ontologies typically associated with traditional semantic data modeling.

The figure above ilustrates the role of the `S2DM` approach.
One can distinghish three areas:
the re-use of existing resources (left), the artifacts offered by `S2DM` (center), and the resulting domain data model created and maintained with `S2DM` artifacts (right).
