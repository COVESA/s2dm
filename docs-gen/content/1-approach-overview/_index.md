The design of `S2DM` can be summarized in these parts:
1. [Objects & Fields](/s2dm/1-approach-overview/1.1-objects-and-properties) – Model the objects of interest (i.e., entities, events, features, etc.) and their fields (i.e., properties).
2. [Concept URIs](/s2dm/1-approach-overview/1.2-concept-uris) – Concepts from the objects and fields are assigned future-proof URIs.
3. [Multi hierarchies](/s2dm/1-approach-overview/1.3-multi-hierarchies) – Concept URIs are reused to build arbitrary classification schemes.
4. [Variant IDs](/s2dm/1-approach-overview/1.4-variant-ids) – Based on the metadata in the specification, a unique hashed ID is created.
5. [Specification registry](/s2dm/1-approach-overview/1.5-spec-registry) – URIs and hashed IDs are combined into a specification registry.
6. [Capabilities](/s2dm/1-approach-overview/1.6-capabilities) – Possible operations to the data structures are specified.
