The design of `S2DM` can be summarized in these parts:

1. [Objects & Fields](objects-and-fields/)
Model the objects of interest (i.e., entities, events, features, etc.) and their fields (i.e., properties).

2. [Concept URIs](concept-uris/)
Concepts from the objects and fields are assigned future-proof URIs.

3. [Multi hierarchies](multi-hierarchies/)
Concept URIs are reused to build arbitrary classification schemes.

4. [Variant IDs](variant-ids/)
Based on the metadata in the specification, a unique hashed ID is created.

5. [Specification registry](specification-registry/)
URIs and hashed IDs are combined into a specification registry.

6. [Capabilities](capabilities/)
Possible operations to the data structures are specified.
