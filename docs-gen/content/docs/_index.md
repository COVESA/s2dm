# S2DM Documentation

Welcome to the complete documentation for the **Simplified Semantic Data Modeling** (S2DM) approach. This documentation is organized into three main sections:

## Documentation Sections

The documentation is structured to guide you through understanding, implementing, and using S2DM:

- **[Approach Overview]({{< relref "approach-overview" >}})** - Learn the fundamental concepts and principles of S2DM
- **[Data Modeling Guideline]({{< relref "data-modeling-guideline" >}})** - Step-by-step guide to modeling your domain with S2DM
- **[Tools]({{< relref "tools" >}})** - Available tools and utilities to support your S2DM implementation

Each section contains detailed information to help you effectively use the S2DM approach for your data modeling needs.

`S2DM` artifacts are based on the following existing resources. Getting familiar with them is recommended.

- **Modeling languages and vocabularies**
    - [GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/): Provides a clear, human-readable syntax for defining data structures and relationships, making it easy for SMEs to understand and use without requiring deep technical expertise.
    - [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/): An RDF-based vocabulary that offers a straightforward framework for creating and managing hierarchical classifications and relationships between concepts, facilitating intuitive and semantically rich knowledge organization.

- **Tools**
    - [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io): For working with RDF data in Python (e.g., `SKOS`).
    - [graphql-core](https://graphql-core-3.readthedocs.io): For working with `GraphQL` schemas in Python (e.g., `SDL`).
