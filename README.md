# Simplified Semantic Data Modeling (S2DM)
Welcome to the Simplified Semantic Data Modeling (S2DM) repository.
S2DM is an approach for modeling data of multiple domains.
It is **_simple_** in the sense that any Subject Matter Expert (SME) could contribute to a controlled vocabulary with minimal data modeling expertise.
Likewise, it is **_semantic_** in the sense that it specifies meaningful data structures, their cross-domain relationships, and arbitrary classification schemes.

> **Disclaimer:** Bear in mind the word `Simplified` in the name.
This approach aims to foster the adoption of (some) good data modeling practices.
It does not intent to re invent, nor to replace long-standing standards, such as those of the Semantic Web.
Hence, this approach does not incorporate advanced reasoning capabilities or the use of comprehensive ontologies typically associated with traditional semantic data modeling.


S2DM adopts data modeling best practices and reuses the following elements:
- [GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).
It provides a clear, human-readable syntax for defining data structures and relationships, making it easy for SMEs to understand and use without requiring deep technical expertise.
- [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/).
It offers a straightforward framework for creating and managing hierarchical classifications and relationships between concepts, facilitating the organization and retrieval of knowledge in a way that is both intuitive and semantically rich..

To learn more about the background that has led to S2DM, as well as its design principles, please read the [S2DM Approach Primer](docs/s2dm_approach_primer.md).
