 Simplified Semantic Data Modeling (S2DM)
</h2>

`S2DM` is an approach for modeling data across multiple domains. It is designed to be simple and accessible for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) while incorporating semantic principles to define meaningful data structures and relationships.

### Key Features:
- **GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)**: Provides a human-readable syntax for defining data structures and relationships.
- **Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)**: Facilitates hierarchical classifications and semantic relationships.

### Core Principle:
`S2DM` promotes a data-centric architecture by enabling systems in the physical layer (e.g., databases, applications) to share common concepts modeled in a unified conceptual layer.
