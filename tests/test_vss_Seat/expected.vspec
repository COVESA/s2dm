  comment: In VSS it is assumed that tilting a seat affects both seating (seat bottom) and backrest, i.e. the angle
           between seating and backrest will not be affected when changing Tilt.

  datatype: float
  type: actuator

  description: Backrest recline compared to seat z-axis (seat vertical axis).
               0 degrees = Upright/Vertical backrest.
               Negative degrees for forward recline. Positive degrees for backward recline.
  comment:     Seat z-axis depends on seat tilt. This means that movement of backrest due to seat tilting will not
               affect Backrest.Recline as long as the angle between Seating and Backrest are constant.
               Absolute recline relative to vehicle z-axis can be calculated as Tilt + Backrest.Recline.
