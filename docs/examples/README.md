## About the examples
Below are some examples of how this data modeling approach can be used in diferent areas or cases:
> If your use case is not covered by the presented examples, do not hesitate to get in touch. If this approach suits your use case, we will add it here.
- [E0) Ground truth models for DASH](https://atc-github.azure.cloud.bmw/coffee/ecosys.data_models/tree/feat/graphql-sdl/models/spec). Conceptual models that serve as the ground truth specification of concepts used in the Data Aggregation and Synchronization Hub (DASH).
- [E1) Vehicle data](/examples/e1_vehicle_data/). This is similar to what the [Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification) currently covers.
- [E2) Multiple domains](/examples/e2_multiple_domains/). Covering cross refences. This is not currently possible with [Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
- [E3) Context information](/examples/e3_context/). Modeling diverse background information that is relevant for particular applications.
- [E4) IPA API](/examples/e4_ipa_api/). Modeling allowed operations.
- [E5) Capabilities](/examples/e5_capabilities/). Specifying the possible operations linked to specific objects or entities.
- [E6) Multiple hierarchies](/examples/e6_multi_hierarchies/). Enabling multiple classification schemes with SKOS.
- [E7) Events](/examples/e7_events/). Capturing events in the model.
- [E8) Alignments with Android properties](/examples/e8_android_properties/)
